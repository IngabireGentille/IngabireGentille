	<h1>DAIRY COMPANY</h1><br><br><br><br>
	<span>The Project Diary is a summation of all of the daily activities on a project. This diary
should be written so that it will represent the status of the project each calendar day to
anyone reviewing it in future years. <br>
 The Project Diary should consist of a Project Diary summary sheet (Form CU-D),
followed by all of the original Inspectorâ€™s Daily Reports. The Project Diary sheets should be
bound between two Project Diary cover sheets to an approximate thickness of 1-1/2 inches.
It is not necessary to bind Project Diaries by month. These cover sheets are preprinted with
the required project and book information on the outside front cover, significant dates, and
Resident Engineer review on the inside front cover, and instructions for the diary preparation
on the inside back cover.</span> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>
